# Space Computation Core

This repository presents the concept of the **Space Computation Core**—a large-scale, solar-powered computing infrastructure deployed in Earth’s geosynchronous orbit. It aims to offload global computational tasks from terrestrial centers and reduce environmental impact.

## Project Overview

- **Name:** Space Computation Core
- **Initiator:** Hakbong Oh (吴学奉)
- **Goal:** Build a zero-gravity, solar-driven, heat-efficient computing hub in orbit.
- **Motivation:** Eliminate the burden of terrestrial data centers and their thermal footprint.

## Core Mechanism

1. **Solar Power Collection**  
   Giant solar panels provide continuous power, especially in geosynchronous orbit.

2. **Air-Circulation Heat Conversion**  
   Heat from computing cores is captured and used to drive air-based turbines, leveraging the vacuum of space for high-efficiency circulation and energy recovery.

3. **Zero-Gravity Efficiency**  
   Minimal friction allows sustained air and turbine motion with low energy input, maximizing power output.

4. **Self-Sustaining Loop**  
   Heat → Air circulation → Mechanical rotation → Electricity → Compute → Heat.

## Project Status

Initial theory and architecture outlined. Now collecting feedback, refining energy models, and preparing for simulation.
