# Architecture of SBCC

## Structure

- Huge space-based structure stationed in geosynchronous orbit.
- Front side faces the sun for continuous solar energy intake.
- Rear side remains in shadow, creating a temperature differential for air circulation.

## Functional Units

- High-efficiency solar panels.
- Air loop channels powered by chip heat and cooled by space-facing radiators.
- Fan turbines distributed in the loop for continuous energy regeneration.
- Heat-driven air currents create near-frictionless motion in microgravity.

## Scale

- Structure size comparable to small moons.
- Sufficient surface area and internal volume for large-scale computing and air systems.
