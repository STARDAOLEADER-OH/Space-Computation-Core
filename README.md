# Space Computation Core

**A revolutionary orbital computing infrastructure** designed to shift intensive global computation off Earth into a sustainable space-based environment.

## Key Features

- ☀️ **Solar-powered computation**: Harvests solar energy via large-scale photovoltaic arrays positioned in geosynchronous orbit.
- ♻️ **Air-circulation energy system**: Utilizes internal hot-cold airflow differences to drive turbines in a microgravity environment, producing additional electricity with minimal resistance.
- 🔄 **Closed-loop thermal dynamics**: Converts heat from computation into kinetic air currents, maintaining system temperature while generating power.
- 💻 **Massive distributed processing**: Capable of hosting supercomputing tasks for Earth-bound clients, reducing terrestrial data center heat and power load.
- 🌍 **Eco-oriented design**: Aims to eliminate ground-based CO₂ emissions caused by data infrastructure by relocating the heat and load to space.

## Mission

To build the first generation of planetary-scale space-based computing hubs, leveraging orbital conditions to push the boundaries of sustainable computation.
