# SBCC: Space-Based Computing Center

A visionary infrastructure project aiming to shift humanity's major computing workloads into orbit. The SBCC (Space-Based Computing Center) proposes a solar-powered, low-friction, energy-circulating superstructure that runs computations in space and sends results to Earth.

## Core Idea

- Utilize solar energy in space to power data centers.
- Convert chip heat to air circulation, which drives turbines to regenerate electricity.
- Establish a nearly closed-loop energy system with minimal waste.
- Eliminate the environmental footprint of Earth's data centers.
