# Energy Circulation Model

## Key Principles

- Heat from processors generates rising air currents.
- Cold space-facing back induces airflow, forming a closed loop.
- Embedded fan generators harvest this motion to regenerate electricity.

## Advantages in Space

- Microgravity reduces friction and resistance.
- Once motion is initiated, minimal input maintains airflow.
- Airflow feeds both cooling and power generation systems.
- No gravitational drag ensures ultra-efficient motion-to-electric conversion.

## Sustainability

- System forms a dynamic balance of computation → heat → air motion → energy.
- Autonomous operations with minimal external intervention.
- No pollution, no atmospheric concerns.
